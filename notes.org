gcc-cross-avr-toolchain

** simavr

The =--add-trace= command line argument really sucks. On some
combination the program simply segfault.

Maybe I'll retry in the future, here's the makefile rule that I used
to test simavr (without the =--add-trace= arguments):

#+begin_src makefile
  # Simulate
  %.vcd: %.hex
          simavr --mcu attiny13 -f 9600000 -ff $<

  .PHONY: clean
  clean:
          rm -f *.vcd
#+end_src

** qemu

Qemu can emulate some AVR **system**, like an arduino uno for
example. You can get a nice serial terminal, but it lacks a lot of
peripheral, I think only the USART is implemented.
